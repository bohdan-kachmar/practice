Psychic spies from China
Try to steal your mind's elation
And little girls from Sweden
Dream of silver-screen quotation
And if you want these kind of dreams
It's Californication

It's the edge of the world
And all of Western civilization
The Sun may rise in the East
At least it settled in a final location
It's understood that Hollywood sells Californication

Pay your surgeon very well
To break the spell of aging
Celebrity skin: Is this your chin
Or is that war you're waging?

First born unicorn
Hardcore soft porn

Dream of Californication
Dream of Californication

Marry me, girl, be my fairy to the world
Be my very own constellation
A teenage bride with a baby inside
Getting high on information
And buy me a star on the boulevard
It's Californication

Space may be the final frontier
But it's made in a Hollywood basement
And, Cobain, can you hear the spheres
Singing songs off Station to Station?
And Alderaan's not far away
It's Californication
